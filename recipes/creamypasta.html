        <li>Butter </li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Gochujang</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Pasta Water</li>

        <li>Parmesan Cheese (Optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and season with salt to taste. Add the 
            pasta and give the it a stir. Cook the pasta to al-dente, about 10 to 12 
            minutes or according to the package instructions. Make sure to stir 
            occasionally. </li>
        <li>While the pasta is boiling, make the sauce. First, add 2 tablespoons of 
            butter into a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Once the butter has
             melted, add the garlic and saute until fragrant. </li>
        <li>Add the gochujang paste and cook briefly, about 30 seconds or until 
            fragrant and combined with the garlic.</li>
        <li>Pour the heavy cream into the pan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. 
            Mix the sauce until the gochujang and heavy cream are well combined. Set 
            aside until the pasta is ready.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is al-dente, reserve Â½ cup of the pasta water. Then, drain 
            the pasta well.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved pasta water and sugar into the gochujang cream sauce and 
            stir to combine. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and add the 
            drained pasta. Let the pasta simmer in the sauce for about 2 to 3 minutes, 
            or until the sauce thickens enough to coat the pasta well. Stir and toss 
            the pasta frequently.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is thick and the pasta is well coated, turn off the heat 
            and add the last tablespoon of butter and the sliced green onions. 
            Constant stir and swirl the pan until the butter is well combined.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta immediately and garnish with some more green onions and 
            your desired amount of grated parmesan. Enjoy!</li>
